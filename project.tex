   \subsection{Merge Sort}
      \subsubsection{Algorithm}
        Merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, based on the
        divide-and-conquer design.  Its average and worst cases are both $n
        log(n)$, and its best case is $\Omega(n)$.  Invented in 1945 by John
        von Neumann, it exploits the fact that combining two lists of sorted
        data is a linear-time process.  
      \subsubsection{Efficiency}
        The actual code for the algorithm is available in \textbf{Listing
        \ref{code:mergesort}}.  This particular implementation uses an
        optimization that switches to insertion sort on small arrays.  This
        speeds up the algorithm because it allows the small data set to fit
        entirely in cache along with the small amount of code associated with
        the insertion sort algorithm.  See \textbf{Listing
        \ref{code:mergesort-parallel}} for a parallel implementation of merge
        sort.
      \subsubsection{Applications}
        Merge sort is useful in applications where the data set will not fit
        entirely into memory.  This allows for the data to be read in from disk
        and sorted as it is read, thus requiring a very small memory footprint.
        In addition, when time complexity needs to be guaranteed, merge sort is
        preferable over quicksort, as quicksort's worst case is $O(n^2)$.
